The HTLV-1 Tax protein has been demonstrated to be the oncogenic protein of the virus. Tax may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including upregulating the expression of cellular genes involved in T cell growth and proliferation, including IL-2, IL-2R-alpha, and IL-15. However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression. This finding suggests that epigenetic change, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in the leukemogenesis of ATL.</data><data key="ko">H00009</data><data key="disease_category">Cancer</data></node>

It appears to result primarily from the decreased synthesis of collagen, a major protein in the body dependent on vitamin C for its biosynthesis. However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C. The diagnosis of scurvy is generally based on clinical features and dietary history, and there is rapid resolution of signs and symptoms after vitamin C supplementation.</data></node>

Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN.

HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&amp;H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).</data><data key="ko">H00007</data><data key="disease_category">Cancer</data></node>

The main initial symptoms of zinc deficiency are dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, and loss of appetite. Currently, at least two zinc transporters from separate protein families are now known to be involved in the genetics of zinc deficiency. One is SLC39A4/ZIP4, which mutations can cause acrodermatitis enteropathica (AEZ) [DS:H00212] with autosomal recessive inheritance. The other one is SLC30A2/ZnT2, the transporter responsible for supplying human milk with zinc. Mutations in this transporter cause TNZD with symptoms similar to AE but with autosomal dominant inheritance. The two diseases can be distinguished in affected infants. AE is fatal if zinc is not supplied to the infant after weaning, whereas TNZD is a genetic defect of the mother limiting the supply of zinc in the milk, and therefore the infant usually will obtain enough zinc once weaned. Furthermore, the mothers' blood zinc levels are normal, and zinc supplementation to the mother's diet fails to improve the zinc levels in the breast milk.</data></node>

HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.</data></node>

Osteonecrosis is a pathological process in which cellular death in the bone constituents occurs because of decreased blood flow or an interruption in the blood supply. ANFH occurs mainly in young individuals between 30 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestations of ANFH, including pain on exertion, limping gait, and discrepancy in leg length, cause considerable disability. The etiology of ANFH is unknown, but previous studies have indicated that heritable thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis, alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk factors for ANFH. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a particular type of femoral head necrosis occurring in children. It is more common among boys, and bilateral involvement occurs in 8-24% of cases. The disease is usually diagnosed among children under age 14 years, with a peak onset between 5 and 8 years of age. There is delayed skeletal maturation and impaired growth. In addition to congenital abnormalities, LCPD is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the blood. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported that COL2A1 mutations are associated with this disease. Recent studies have suggested that an association exists between ANFH and genetic polymorphisms in the plasminogen activator inhibitor (SERPINE1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) genes.</data></node>

More than 20 common viruses, including coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been associated with myocarditis in humans. However, coxsackieviruses are considered the dominant cause of myocarditis, particularly in neonates and young children. After the acute phase caused by direct cytopathic effects of the virus, a small proportion of patients subsequently develop autoimmune- mediated, chronic myocarditis [4], accompanied by circulating autoantibodies to cardiac myosin and other heart antigens, which can sometimes lead to heart failure and death associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

The prothrombin time is prolonged by 4-6 seconds or more. While the etiologies of FHF are multiple and varied, viral hepatitis is the most frequent cause. Around 40-60% of patients with FHF are thought to be due to some viral infection. The prognosis is dependent on several factors, including the underlying cause of liver failure. For instance, it is well known that the spontaneous recovery rates from FHF from such etiologies as hepatitis A and acetaminophen toxicity are high, whereas those same rates for other types of viral hepatitis and idiosyncratic drug reactions are quite low. Identification of the cause of FHF is important because some causes have specific treatment interventions or antidotes. Specific therapies include N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose, and acyclovir for herpesvirus infection. Different therapeutic options such as complete exchange blood transfusion, corticosteroids, and plasma pheresis, have been tried. However, the overall prognosis for patients with FHF is quite poor, with survival rates usually reported between 10% and 30% without liver transplantation.</data><data key="ko">H01712</data><data key="disease_category">Liver disease</data></node>

The vast majority of BCC cases are sporadic, though there is a rare familial syndrome basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, or Gorlin syndrome) that predisposes to development of BCC. In addition, there is strong epidemiological and genetic evidence that demonstrates UV exposure as a risk factor of prime importance. The development of basal cell carcinoma is associated with constitutive activation of sonic hedgehog signaling. The mutations in SMOH, PTCH1, and SHH in BCCs result in continuous activation of target genes. At a cellular level, sonic hedgehog signaling promotes cell proliferation.

The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease.

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is a pediatric sarcoma that typically occurs in older children predominantly arising in the trunk and extremities, and exhibits a worse prognosis than other types of RMSs. ARMS is associated with 2;13 or 1;13 chromosomal translocations, which generate PAX3-FOXO1A and PAX7-FOXO1A fusion products, respectively. These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.</data><data key="ko">H00037</data><data key="disease_category">Cancer</data></node>

While DPB is frequently compared with cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease encountered in Caucasians, neither pancreatic insufficiency nor any obvious abnormalities of the sweat electrolytes are seen in DPB, and the two are considered to be entirely different diseases. Immunogenetic studies revealed a strong association with human HLA-B54 in Japanese, whereas an association with HLA-A11 was reported in Koreans. These findings imply that a major susceptibility gene may be located between the HLA-A and HLA-B loci on the short arm of human chromosome 6. Recently, novel mucin-like genes has been cloned in this candidate region. And it was found that their polymorphisms were associated with DPB. Over the past two decades, DPB has shifted from being a near-fatal to a treatable disease. A significant improvement in the prognosis of this disease has been attributed to the long-term use of macrolides. The five-year survival rate increased to about 90% after treatment with erythromycin became widely used.</data></node>

The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.</data></node>

Although the precise pathophysiologic mechanism underlying NMS remains unknown, a reduction in dopaminergic activity in the brain probably by dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum and hypothalamus is generally assumed as a potential cause. Laboratory findings include elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CK), liver enzymes, and leukocitosis. Treatment includes immediately stopping the offending agent and implementing supportive measures, as well as pharmacological interventions in more severe cases.</data></node>

The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood.

The prototypical clinical characteristics of PRP are follicular hyperkeratotic papules on an erythematous base that can eventually coalesce to large red plaques. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. It is comprised of widespread, follicular papules and plaques and tends to clear spontaneously in 80% of patients in one to three years. Type II, which is the atypical adult subtype, tends to be more chronic and presents with areas of alopecia, eczematous patches, and a palmoplantar keratoderma. The classic juvenile type III is observed in only 10% of patients. It is similar clinically to type I but occurs in children and tends to remit in one year. Type IV, which is the circumscribed, juvenile subtype, presents with sharply-demarcated areas of follicular hyperkeratosis and erythema of the elbows and knees. An estimated 5% of children with PRP develop an atypical form classified as juvenile type V. Most familial cases that are published belong to this group. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Treatment of PRP can be difficult, and no standardized approach has been established, although systemic retinoids are considered first-line therapy.

The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible.

It is associated with genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in a cluster of imprinted genes found within a genomic region of approximately one megabase on chromosome 11p15. The imprinted region 11p15 is separated into two domains, with each domain regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control regions (ICR). The centromeric ICR2 regulates the expression of CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and further genes. The majority of cases of BWS show hypomethylation in the ICR2 or mutations in the ICR2-regulated CDKN1C gene. In intron 10 of the KCNQ1 locus, the untranslated KCNQ1OT1 RNA is encoded. KCNQ10T1 is expressed by the paternal allele and probably represses realization of the CDKN1C gene. In the telomeric ICR1, hypermethylation of the H19 promoter and loss of imprinting of IGF2 have been reported in a small fraction of patients with BWS. A few BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations.</data></node>

LH is synthesized similarly within the pituitary gland, requiring the same stimulus as FSH, the GnRH from the hypothalamus. Both hypothalamic abnormalities and intrinsic pituitary abnormalities can cause an abnormal FSH/LH response to GnRH. Hypersecretion of gonadotropins are often associated with pituitary adenomas [DS:H01102] and central precocious puberty [DS:H00937]. Hyposecretion of gonadotropins [DS:H00255 H01700] in premenopausal women leads to absent menstrual cycles, infertility, vaginal dryness, and loss of some female characteristics.

The urea cycle function may be impaired by substrate deficiencies assumed cause in various disorders including lysinuric protein intolerance, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency, and fatty acid oxidation defects.

This disease is usually triggered by an infection, which provokes immune-mediated nerve dysfunction. GBS can be subdivided into the classic acute demyelinating type, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Classic acute demyelinating type is designated acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), representing the great majority of cases in Europe and North America. A mutation in the PMP22 gene was identified in a family with AIDP. AMAN is the most prevalent form in China. The incidence of AMSAN is very low. The axonal forms of GBS are caused by certain autoimmune mechanisms, due to a molecular mimicry between antecedent bacterial infection (particularly Campylobacter jejuni) and human peripheral nerve gangliosides.</data></node>

PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.</data></node>

Most congenital scoliosis is often recognized at birth, but more subtle spinal defects can remain undetected. A close interaction of genes and environment regulates the development of normal spine. Developmental studies in animal models have identified many genes regulating somite formation and segmentation. Patients with congenital scoliosis frequently have other associated anomalies. Sometimes rib fusion or absence can be observed along with the spinal anomalies since ribs are formed in close association with the vertebrae. When the number of ribs on the right or left side do not match, congenital vertebral anomalies should be suspected. An extensive thoracic congenital scoliosis associated with fused ribs may affect thoracic function and the growth of the lungs in young children and lead to a thoracic insufficiency syndrome.

Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC.

The cause of PR is uncertain but epidemiological (seasonal variation and clustering in communities) and clinical features suggest an infective agent. Light and electron microscopy findings suggest infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6/7). HHV-6 and HHV-7 may also interact with each other, explaining recurrences and atypical presentations. PR is self limiting and resolves within one to three months. It typically starts with the development of a large erythematous scaly plaque also called the herald patch or mother patch on trunk or neck, which is followed by an eruption of multiple secondary small erythematous scaly lesions located predominantly on the trunk and following the lines of cleavage on the back (Christmas tree or inverted fir tree appearance). Collarette scaling is seen typically. The eruption is usually preceded by a prodrome of sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever, and arthralgia. A case of PR is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds. A biopsy is needed in atypical cases, and it mainly helps in excluding other differentials rather than diagnosing PR as the histopathological examination in a case of PR is relatively nonspecific and resembles a subacute or chronic dermatitis. As PR is a self-limiting disorder, most patients just need to be counseled regarding the natural course of the disease instead of putting them on an aggressive treatment protocol. Most patients would just need emollients, antihistaminics, and sometimes topical steroids to control pruritus.</data></node>

The association with ANCAs originally defined the group of ANCA-associated vasculitides, comprising granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) [DS:H01655], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [DS:H01468], which have different frequencies of ANCA-positivity. ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis is mainly established by clinical manifestations, computed tomography (TC), ANCA antibody detection, and renal and pulmonary biopsy. The introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment has substantially improved the prognosis. The standardized therapeutic regimen is based on cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids.

Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years.

Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful. Biopsy is rarely needed to confirm the diagnosis. First-line therapies for most patients are topical treatments such as topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs.

In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients.

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).</data></node>

This disease is characterized by erosion, sclerosis, and ossification, which may result in complete fusion and rigidity of the spine. Regarding extra-articular manifestations, the most frequent is anterior uveitis. The major functional losses occur during the first 10 years of disease. It usually begins in the second or third decade of life, preferentially in HLA-B27-positive Caucasian males. Its etiology and pathogenesis are not completely understood, but the most prevalent hypothesis involves immune mediation as its major mechanism, including several cytokines. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been identified that influence the risk of developing AS, including HLA alleles such as HLA-B27. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to reduce pain and inflammation. Additional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed to slowdown disease progression. The most frequently applied biological agents approved for AS are TNF alpha inhibitors.

The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.</data></node>

The risk factors of ASO include age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There are no definitive treatments for ASO. The efficacy of surgical treatment is not satisfactory, and medication is required to maintain the postoperative vascular patency. In order to relieve symptoms such as cold sensation and intermittent claudication, drug therapy such as antiplatelet therapy and vasodilatory drugs are useful in the treatment of some patients with ASO. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has also been applied for the treatment of ASO. At present, the diagnosis of ASO depends on several clinical tests, such as angiography, estimations of ankle/brachial index (ABI), and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), as well as the measurement of circulating hs-CRP levels. However, these examinations can only be detectable when ASO already developed, and there was no predictable markers for ASO in its earlier stages. Recent studies have reported that some micro RNAs could be serum markers for early-stage ASO.</data></node>

This causes hematuria, albuminuria and loss of renal function. From an immunopathologic standpoint, primary RPGN is divided into pauci-immune GN (PIGN), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM) GN, and immune complex GN. PIGN, the most common etiology of primary RPGN, refers to a necrotizing glomerulonephritis with few or no immune deposits by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Approximately 90% of patients with PICG have circulating ANCA antibodies, leading to the systemic small vessel vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide are the first-line treatment, but infection is the most common cause of death of RPGN patients.

Patients spend a significant amount of time each day picking their skin, that causes psychosocial impairment. Triggers to pick vary greatly. For example, stress, anxiety, boredom, and feeling tired or angry have all been reported as triggers. Co-occurring psychiatric conditions are common in this disease. The most commonly reported comorbid conditions are trichotillomania, substance dependence, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). So far, there is no clear neurobiological explanation for the etiology of this disease. Recent research showed bilateral abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex and abnormalities on the left temporoparietal junction. Another study has shown deficits in motor inhibition, which appears to be correlated with frontal cortex abnormalities. Furthermore, severity of excoriation disorder may be associated with higher levels of impulsivity. Treatment for this disease has largely focused on cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacology. Early psychosocial treatment studies provided evidence for skin picking reduction with habit reversal or acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT). The data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy in this disease are not convincing, although some studies suggested that fluoxetine is effective. Tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, and the dopamine-blocking opioid antagonist have also been found to be effective for skin-picking.</data></node>

Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.</data></node>

MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, involving predominantly the cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron and oculomotor systems. Minor, but more specific, features such as external progressive ophthalmoplegia (EPO), dystonia, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, as well as bulging eyes, may also be of major importance for the clinical diagnosis of MJD. The mean age at onset is around 40 years. MJD is associated with CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene. CAG repeat varies in size among affected persons. There is no effective treatment of ataxia. Case series and small controlled trials of several medications including antianxiolytics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics have shown limited efficacy.</data></node>

The lower thoracic spine is most commonly affected. Previous hyperkyphosis and mechanical stress are thought to be predisposing conditions. It is tempting to think that OLF is genetically or pathologically inherited based on abnormalities of calcium or phosphate metabolism, on endocrinologic abnormalities, or on the presence of autoimmune disease. Such relationships, however, have not been documented. Treatment of cervical stenosis related to OLF is based on the standard principle of managing neural spinal abnormalities. Acute episodes of pain and onset of or increase in neurological deficits are treated with rest, external spinal immobilization with a collar or brace, and analgesics, anti-inflammatory, and/or antispasmodic medicines.

After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.</data></node>

Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3.

Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children. The treatment of hypopituitarism typically involves a replacement of the deficient hormone but care must be taken because several studies have reported an increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders and number of deaths among these patients.</data></node>

Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5.

The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease worldwide, and CRS may be divided into ECRS and non-ECRS subtypes based on the presence of tissue eosinophilic infiltration or not. There are significant geographic and ethnic differences in the tissue eosinophilic infiltration, which is predominant in Western white patients and less common in East Asians, despite an increasing tendency for its prevalence in East Asia countries. ECRS commonly demonstrates more severe symptoms, polyp diseases with a higher incidence of bilateral polyps and sinonasal diseases on computed tomography, and the increase in blood eosinophils. Patients with ECRS exhibit clinical characteristics that include long term nasal congestion, mucus production, olfactory disturbances, bilateral nasal polyposis, and intermittent acute exacerbation of secondary bacterial infections. Since there is no approved medication to treat patients with ECRS with nasal polyps completely, surgery is often needed to clear the sinonasal passage, and repeated endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often required. The effectiveness of low-dose, long-term erythromycin treatment (macrolide therapy) was reported for the treatment of CRS in Japan.</data></node>

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators.

Less frequently, Chiari malformations are acquired after birth. Causes of acquired Chiari malformations involve injuries, exposure to harmful substances, infections. More rarely, chronic subdural hematoma can be the cause of progressive caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils. Chiari malformations were classified by Hans Chiari in 1891, into four groups. Chiari malformation type I (CM I), the most frequent of Chiari malformations, is characterized by the inferior displacement of cerebellar tonsillas through the foramen magnum. This leads to different symptoms and clinical features, such as headaches, syringomyelia, and hydrocephalus. CM II is characterized by displacement of the parts of the inferior vermis, pons, and medulla oblongata together with elongation of the fourth ventricle. Most cases are associated with myelomeningocele. CM III is characterized by an occipital or cervical encephalocele along with the intracranial abnormalities seen with CM II malformation and a wide foramen magnum.

Several systemic and extraglandular manifestations can develop, including fatigue, arthritis, and involvement of organs such as the skin, lungs, and kidneys. SS may occur as a primary disorder or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases, traditionally defined as secondary SS, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Salivary secretions from these patients exhibit elevated levels of antibodies and cytokines. This is accompanied by a reduction in oral phosphate levels and xerostomia due to reduced salivary flow, which can lead to infections, progressive caries, dysphagia and oral pain. Current tests for SS include sialometry, salivary scintigraphy, sialography, serological tests or minor salivary gland biopsies. Recently, salivary biomarkers of SS has been investigated. The etiology of SS is still unclear. Since there is a familial aggregation of primary SS, however, genetic factors have been suspected for a long time. Initially, HLA haplotypes were shown to be associated with primary SS. Recently, polymorphisms in the genes IRF5 and STAT4 have been convincingly identified and replicated in several studies as susceptibility factors.</data></node>

It affects mainly elderly men, and involves the ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament (OALL). Although it is asymptomatic in some occasions, the disease may produce dysphagia, dysphonia, and exceptionally breathing difficulties due to airway compromise. In these cases, early surgery is recommended to alleviate airway obstruction. Although the hallmark of the DISH is considered to be the anterolateral aspect of the thoracic spine, various signs and symptoms is not limited to the spine and has often been reported to involve multiple peripheral locations as well. While the cause of DISH remains unclear, mechanical factors, genetic factors, environmental factors, drugs, and metabolic conditions have been hypothesized to be relevant. Most of the current theories focus on the pathologic OALL. There's no cure for DISH. Therapy for DISH is based on symptomatic and empiric treatment. In general, physical therapy, analgesics, antiinflammatory drugs, and muscle relaxants have been successful in managing the majority of patients with DISH.</data></node>

Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy. It is also often seen in a number of tubulointerstitial renal diseases. Finally, a great number of drugs may induce hyperkalemic RTA.</data></node>

DEH can be differentiated from Meniere's disease. The age of onset of symptoms is typically in later childhood and adolescence or between 40 and 60 years of age. DEH probably is caused by atrophy or fibrous obliteration of the endolymphatic resorptive system of the membranous labyrinth. It has been reported that genetic factors may sometimes be the cause of this disease. Two types of DEH exist: the ipsilateral type, in which the ear with profound hearing loss suffers progressive endolymphatic hydrops, and the contralateral type, in which the formation of progressive endolymphatic hydrops takes place in the ear opposite to the previously deafened ear. DEH requires conservative treatment, such as that typically used for Meniere's disease, including the appropriate concomitant use of diuretics, such as isosorbide or steroids for at least 3-6 months. When recurrent episodic vertigo cannot be remedied through conservative treatment, labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy on the deaf ear are curative for ipsilateral DEH.

Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.</data><data key="ko">H00082</data><data key="name">Graves disease</data></node>

Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene.

Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways.

Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC.

Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology. Recently, novel mutations have been discovered in non-NF2 meningiomas.

These disorders are Bloom's syndrome (BS), Werner's syndrome (WS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), which are caused by mutations in BLM, WRN and RECQ4, respectively. Despite the apparent structural and biochemical similarities between the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 proteins, the phenotypes of BS, WS and RTS are different, suggesting that each disease pathway is functionally distinct to some extent. BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination).

KD is a self-limited illness that is not associated with the production of autoantibodies or the deposition of immune complexes, and it rarely recurs. The disease is believed to result from an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. Classic (typical) Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on the presence of a fever lasting five or more days, accompanied by four out of five findings: bilateral conjunctival injection, oral changes such as cracked and erythematous lips and strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes such as erythema or palm and sole desquamation, and polymorphous rash. Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease occurs in persons with fever lasting five or more days and with two or three of these findings. The standard treatment of acute KD is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion and aspirin. However, 10-20% of patients show resistance to IVIG therapy and present higher risk of coronary vasculitis. If there is no response to treatment, patients are given a second dose of IVIG with or without corticosteroids or other adjunctive treatment.</data></node>

The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Cervical stenosis presents with axial neck pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy, or a combination of these presentations. Axial pain refers to pain that occurs along the spinal column, while radiculopathy refers to complaints in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution often occurring in the arms. Patients may complain of numbness, pain or loss of function. Myelopathy refers to a cluster of complaints and findings due to intrinsic damage to the spinal cord itself. Patients might report numbness, coordination and gait issues, grip weakness and bowel and bladder complaint. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a major cause of pain and functional disability for the elderly. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are a hallmark of lumbar spinal stenosis, where patients develop low back or leg pain when walking or standing that is relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion. The treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis generally begins with conservative management such as physical therapy, home exercise programs, and oral analgesics. Once these therapies fail, patients commonly move forward with interventional pain treatment options such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs), nerve block, or surgery as the next step. Coexisting lumbar and cervical stenosis (tandem spinal stenosis) is an infrequent presentation with mixed presentation of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs.

The T wave is large and usually of opposite polarity to the QRS complex. A PVC is usually followed by a full compensatory pause. PVCs are commonly encountered in apparently healthy individuals with a reported incidence of approximately 1% on standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and 40% to 75% on routine 24 hour to 48 hour Holter monitoring. The clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with congestive heart failure. In many patients, ectopic ventricular events manifest as asymptomatic, isolated PVCs that have a benign prognosis in those without structural heart disease. In others, PVCs may be frequent and highly symptomatic, presenting as palpitations, chest discomfort, or presyncope. Clinical evidence suggests that frequent PVCs (variably defined in the literature) are more strongly associated with concomitant cardiac disease. The decision to suppress PVCs is largely based on the presence of symptoms, interference with other therapy (e.g., cardiac resynchronization therapy), or suspicion of PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy. When necessary, treatment for PVCs involves beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or other antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation in selected cases. Catheter ablation of frequent PVCs has been demonstrated to be effective at PVC suppression and is associated with improvement or normalization of ventricular function.</data></node>

Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length Htt is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+  overload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility.

It can occur in three forms: solitary, multicentric or generalised. The solitary form is the commonest and occurs as a single cutaneous nodule. The multicentric form involves the skin, subcutaneous tissues, muscles, and bone. The course is generally benign, with no metastases and regression of the tumor over a period of 12 to 18 months. The generalized form is associated with visceral involvement. This condition has serious prognostic implications as there is a 76% mortality from cardiopulmonary or gastrointestinal complications. While most cases of IM appear to be sporadic, there have been several reports of autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Mutations in the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 genes were recently identified in patients with IM. Treatment options vary widely. Solitary and even multicentric lesions that are confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissues without visceral involvement frequently regress spontaneously.

The phenotypic severity of ET is variable, as evidenced by the existence of both highly disabling and milder forms of the disease. There are three subtypes of ET, namely hereditary, sporadic, and senile, and most studies indicate that ET is a hereditary disorder in more than half of affected individuals (and presumably has autosomal-dominant inheritance). The diagnostic approach includes obtaining a history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. At present, there are no validated serologic, radiologic, or pathological markers.</data></node>

Non-invasive PD can principally be divided into sinusitis, acute otitis media, and community-acquired pneumonia. S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The invasive PD burden is mainly determined by pneumococcal meningitis, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal bacteremia without a primary focus.

Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis.

On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes.

Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression. ZAP-70 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recurrent and opportunistic infections occur within the first year of life. The mutations in genes responsible for CRAC channel function, ORAI1 and STIM1, cause the defect in Ca2+ influx.</data></node>

Patients demonstrate an unsteady gait and experience frequent falls as they learn to walk. ARSACS is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, encoding a large protein sacsin. A recent study demonstrated that sacsin may interact with the Hsp70 chaperone machinery, which is an important component of the cellular response towards aggregation prone mutant proteins that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases.</data></node>

Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis. The two entities are distinguished on the basis of the immunohistological pattern of C3 and the electron microscopy detection of ribbon-like electron-dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane in DDD, versus deposits of usual density in C3 glomerulonephritis.</data><data key="ko">H01726</data><data key="name">Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis</data><data key="disease_category">Immune system disease; Urinary system disease</data></node>

AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.</data></node>

Despite clinical features mimicking infection or multiple sclerosis, the discovery of the green hairy tongue and the green urine in SMON patients aroused researchers' interest and thereby began solving the cause of SMON. The green color was derived from a chelate compound of clioquinol with ferric iron. A large number of SMON were observed throughout Japan, and the total number of cases reached nearly 10,000 by 1970. After the governmental ban on the use of clioquinol in September 1970, there was a dramatic disappearance of new case of SMON. However, in Japan, there are still more than 2500 SMON patients suffering from severe dysesthesia/paresthesia and ataxic paraplegia.</data></node>

HAdV-8, HAdV-19, and HAdV-37 are common causative agents of EKC. In addition to these above-mentioned types, HAdV-3, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, HAdV-9, HAdV-15, HAdV-53, and HAdV-54 have also been identified as causative agents of EKC. However, HAV-8 is responsible for the highest number of EKC cases worldwide and is associated with severe clinical manifestations. EKC patients may complain about influenza-like symptoms, including fever, malaise, respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia. The incubation period is 2-14 days, and the person may remain infectious for 10-14 days after the onset of the symptoms. Symptoms tend to last for 7-21 days.</data></node>

The dermatitis caused by pellagra is a bilaterally symmetrical eruption at cutaneous sites of solar exposure. It tends to be painful to touch during the acute phase and can eventually become so clinically striking that the patient may become ostracized. Untreated pellagra results in death from multiorgan failure. Pellagra used to be a disease of epidemic proportions in the developed world. In the 18th century, it was linked with poverty and subsistence on nutritionally marginal corn-based diets. In the 1940s and 1950s, with expanded biochemical knowledge, pellagra was reformulated as a deficiency disease due to inadequate niacin and its amino acid precursor tryptophan.

Furthermore, insomnia is associated with an increased risk of anxiety and depression, suicidality, and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line therapy. While behavioral therapies are effective for chronic insomnia in some patients, pharmacotherapy is frequently used when immediate short-term symptom relief is needed.

The condition is more common in women who are 20 to 35 years of age and in previously parous women. It is less common in children and nulligravid women. Galactorrhea also can occur in men. After infancy, galactorrhea usually is medication-induced. The most common pathologic cause of galactorrhea is a pituitary tumor. Other causes include hypothalamic and pituitary stalk lesions, neurogenic stimulation, thyroid disorders, and chronic renal failure. Tests for pregnancy, serum prolactin level and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and magnetic resonance imaging are important diagnostic tools that should be employed when clinically indicated. The decision to treat patients with galactorrhea is based on the serum prolactin level, the severity of galactorrhea, and the patient's fertility desires. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders. Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with a medication from a similar class with lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. For women who cannot breastfeed after childbirth for some reasons, various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been used to suppress lactation and relieve associated symptoms.

It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.</data></node>

A highly variable clinical course exists that spans from mild and subtle findings to aggressive life-threatening multisystem disease. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are present in more than 90% of patients, and these ANA react against various intracellular components. However, one patient rarely has two or more types of ANA. The particular ANA types are often indicative of clinical features, disease course and overall severity. At present, there is no treatment that has been proven to modify the overall disease course, but therapy that targets specific organ involvement early before irreversible damage occurs does improve both quality of life and survival. Although the precise pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown, the consensus is that it is triggered in genetically-susceptible individuals by exposure to specific environmental agents.</data></node>

An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the role of the individual trigger factors is controversial. There is a significant association between lichen planus and infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The diagnosis of LP is based on the clinical presentation and should be confirmed by biopsy, if suspected. Histopathology is often conclusive, but in vesiculobullous cutaneous LP or erosive oral LP, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies can be an integral step in differentiating between LP and other diseases.

Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.</data></node>

OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.</data></node>

This disease has been called Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) for many years, and renamed eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in 2012. EGPA is characterized by asthma, hypereosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophilic granulomas. Clinically, three phases may be distinguished. The prodromal phase may persist for many years, consisting of asthma possibly associated with allergic rhinitis and often complicated by recurrent rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. The second phase is characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia or eosinophilic tissue infiltrates. The third phase is dominated by manifestations resulting from systemic vasculitis. Vasculitis commonly affects the skin, nerves, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. It can be serious and life-threatening. EGPA pathogenesis is not well known. The disease is probably the result of a complex interaction in which genetically and environmental factors lead to an inflammatory response whose principal players are eosinophils, T, and B lymphocytes. HLA-DRB1 and DRB4 alleles and IL10.2 haplotype of the IL-10 promoter gene are the most studied genetic determinants. A combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is still the gold standard for the treatment of severe cases, but the use of biological agents such as rituximab or mepolizumab seems to be a promising therapeutic alternative.</data></node>

Range of motion is decreased at the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and the neck and hip girdle may also be involved. These symptoms often persist for at least 1 month and are combined with incapacitating morning stiffness, a decline in general health, and an elevated acute-phase response. Onset of PMR symptoms may be acute or gradual. It is known that PMR patients share many pathogenetic features with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Despite the similarities in age of onset and some of the clinical manifestations, the relationship between GCA and PMR is not yet clearly established. One-third of PMR patients have systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia, but these are often milder than systemic symptoms in GCA patients. PMR is a benign and highly steroid-sensitive disease that should resolve fully with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 12-24 months, although one or two relapses may occur. The diagnosis of PMR is made primarily on clinical grounds and is bolstered by laboratory evidence of an acute-phase reaction. There is no single diagnostic test for PMR, but sets of diagnostic and classification criteria have been suggested by several groups of investigators.</data></node>

The H19 gene encodes a 2.3-kb non-coding mRNA, which is strongly expressed during embryogenesis and possibly functions as a microRNA.

Subsequently, both syndromes were merged and reclassified as Opitz GBBB syndrome. There are two forms of Opitz GBBB syndrome, which are distinguished by their genetic causes and patterns of inheritance. The X-linked form is caused by a mutation in the gene MID1 that encodes an ubiquitin ligase that targets phosphatase 2A for degradation. Autosomal dominant form results from a deletion at chromosome 22q11.2.</data></node>

The von Zumbusch type often starts abruptly and can be associated with painful skin, fever, and chills. The disease course varies from a benign, chronic process to an acute life-threatening episode, and as such optimal treatment depends on severity. Diseases considered within the spectrum of GPP include: impetigo herpetiformis and childhood GPP. Acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and palmoplantar pustulosis are two distinct forms of localized pustular psoriasis. Treatment should be governed by the extent of involvement and severity of disease. Acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and infliximab are considered to be first-line therapies for those with GPP. Adalimumab, etanercept, and psoralen plus ultraviolet A are second-line modalities in this setting. Pustular psoriasis in children, in pregnant women, and in localized forms alter which agents are first-line modalities as concerns such as teratogenicity need to be factored into the decisionmaking for the individual patient.</data></node>

Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons. Its prevalence is 1% to 3% in the general population and 34% to 83% in immunocompromised persons.

The excessive increases or decreases in body water can be lethal. There are numerous pathologic and iatrogenic causes for water imbalance, the most troublesome being disorders of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. ADH is also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP). The prime determinant of free water excretion is the regulation of urinary flow by circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma. Disorders of water metabolism can be divided into hyperosmolar disorders, in which there is a deficiency of body water relative to body solute, and hypo-osmolar disorders, in which there is an excess of body water relative to body solute. The classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus (DI), and the classical hypo-osmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). DI can result from either inadequate AVP secretion (central or neurogenic DI) or inadequate renal response to AVP (nephrogenic DI).

Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).</data><data key="ko">H01648</data><data key="name">Pemphigus</data></node>

It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level. Orally administered tetraycycline derivatives and omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids are also used.</data></node>

The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy broadly involves hyperglycemia, increased circulating fatty acids, and insulin resistance contributing to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired calcium metabolism, Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) activation, and altered substrate metabolism. These effects result in cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte death, contractile dysfunction, endothelial cell damage and eventually heart failure. In the process of cardiac fibrosis, cardiac fibroblasts are the final effector cell.</data></node>

The pathophysiology of AS remains unclear and the causes of AS are not known. The male-to-female ratio is 8:1 in AS. Genetic factors appear to play a role in AS because of their tendency to run in families and the high concordance in twins. However, a specific gene for AS has not been identified.

Typically during puberty or adolescence, the initially quiescent lesion progresses to an expansive mass with cosmetic and functional disturbance. With later progression, the AVM destroys normal tissues and eventually leads to complications such as severe disfigurement, uncontrollable bleeding, ulceration, pain, and cardiac volume overload. A surgical approach is indicated in well-circumscribed malformations of small size.

Impaired functioning of the ClC-1 leads to an increase in sarcolemmal excitability that clinically presents as delayed muscular relaxation (myotonia). Myotonia congenita may be inherited as either an autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease) or recessive trait (Becker disease). The predominant features of Thomsen disease are a painless, transient, muscle stiffness with a predilection for both the upper extremity and the facial muscles. Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita. Like Becker and Thomsen disease, both of these conditions are associated with a defect in the ClC-1.

It is an uncommon but important cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO). SAT is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and occurs concurrently with outbreaks of viral diseases (mumps, measles, influenza). However, the exact etiology is unknown. Clinically, it presents with acute onset of pain in the thyroid region. The pain may be exacerbated by turning the head or swallowing, and may radiate to the jaw, ear or chest. Common initial clinical features include low-grade fever, fatigue, and mild thyrotoxic manifestations. The physical examination, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated thyroglobulin level, and a depressed radioactive iodine uptake confirm the diagnosis. Therapy with antithyroid drugs is not indicated in patients with SAT because this disorder is caused by the release of preformed thyroid hormone rather than synthesis of new T3 and T4. Therapy with beta blockers may be indicated for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally effective in reducing thyroid pain in patients with mild cases. Patients with more severe disease require a tapering dosage of prednisone given over two to four weeks.</data></node>

Though usually transient, SIADH may be chronic. It is often associated with drug use or a lesion in the central nervous system or lung. SIADH is divided into two categories. One is the ectopic ADH syndrome induced by abnormally secreted arginine vasopressin (ADH/AVP) from cancer cells. Another is the morbidity caused by inappropriately secreted ADH from the pituitary gland. In both situations of SIADH, ADH binds to vasopressin V2 receptors (V2Rs) in renal tubules and thereby increasing water reabsorption. SIADH is difficult to distinguish from cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), another cause of hyponatremia characterized by renal loss of sodium and decreases in extracellular fluid volume during intracranial disorders. SIADH occurs in the setting of euvolemia, without evidence of renal disease or thyroxine or cortisol deficiency. Treatment options for SIADH include fluid restriction, demeclocycline, urea, frusemide and saline infusion, all of which have their limitations.

While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons.

Venous malformations are low-flow vascular malformations. Majority of them occur in the head and neck region. Birthmarks in cutaneomucosal venous malformation appear mainly on skin and mucosa, whereas plaques in glomuvenous malformation are located on the extremities, usually nodular and associated with abnormal smooth muscle-like 'glomus cells'. Most cases are unifocal, with extensive venous malformations accounting for only one percent of cases and more commonly manifesting as rare, inherited forms. Venous malformations will grow with age, infiltrating normal structures. They can give rise to functional disabilities, including obstruction to airway and swallowing difficulties. Also, they can cause visual or auditory disturbance and delayed speech development. In addition, bleeding, pain, infection, skeletal deformity, and cosmetic disfigurement may occur. Active treatment of venous malformations is indicated especially in head and neck region. Surgery can cause damage to normal surrounding structures, resulting in significant disfigurement and loss of function. Complete excision is often impossible for infiltrative lesions. Sclerotherapy has gained popularity recently and become the first-line treatment for venous malformations in head and neck region.</data></node>

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors.

The predominant form of sudden SNHL is unilateral in location, and the main aetiology is idiopathic. As the majority of patients (30-65 %) with unilateral sudden SNHL report spontaneous recovery within 2 weeks, unilateral disease is mostly regarded as a benign condition. Prognosis for recovery is dependent on a number of factors, including patient age, presence of vertigo at onset, degree of hearing loss, and time between onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathology of sudden SNHL remains unclear. However, a series of factors, including viral infections, microcirculatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, and labyrinthine hemorrhage, have been proposed as causative factors. Different treatment regimens like antioxidants, corticosteroids, vasodilatators, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), or carbogen therapy have been described. Among these approaches, steroid treatment is the most common.</data></node>

The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes.

Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (&lt;1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21. Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain. A recent paper has suggested that RCAN1 and DYRK1A, localized in the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) of HSA21, may have an impact on the development of multiple tissues.</data><data key="ko">H01552</data><data key="name">Down syndrome</data></node>

MEN1, which is also referred as Wermer's syndrome, is characterized by parathyroid adenoma, gastrinoma, and pituitary adenoma. Gastrinomas are the most common type, leading to the Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome (see H01522). MEN2 are characterized by medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and includes three subtypes: MEN2A (Sipple's syndrome), MEN2B (MEN3) and familial MTC. MEN2A develop MTC in association with phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors. MEN2B develop MTC in association with marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, leading to megacolon. MEN4, also referred to as MENX, appears to have signs and symptoms similar to those of type 1. However MEN4 patients have mutations in other genes.

Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.</data></node>
