HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).", "disease_category": "Cancer", "id": "n44", "ko": "H00007", "label": "n44", "labels": ":disease", "name": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "description": "Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow.

These translocations result in altered expression, function, and subcellular localization of the fusion products relative to the wild-type proteins, and ultimately contribute to oncogenic behavior by modifying growth, differentiation, and apoptosis pathways.", "disease_category": "Cancer", "id": "n210", "ko": "H00037", "label": "n210", "labels": ":disease", "name": "Rhabdomyosarcoma", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "id": "n2577", "ko": "D02177", "label": "n2577", "labels": ":drug", "name": "Bleomycin sulfate", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "description": "Non-melanoma skin cancer, i.e. basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are the most frequent tumors and their number is still increasing world- wide.

Mutations in TP53 have been described in actinic keratoses, in situ SCC, and invasive SCC with UV signature lesions common, and a reported mutation rate as high as 45%.

Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient\u0027s mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown.

Despite ongoing research into the cause of CLE, it remains unclear how CLE relates to SLE pathogenesis. LE-specific skin disease includes the subtypes of CLE such as acute cutaneous LE (ACLE), subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). ACLE is characterized by malar rash or maculopapular eruption on sun exposed areas. SCLE characteristically presents as annular or psoriasiform plaques in a photo distribution. CCLE can be further divided into discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), LE profundus (LEP), chilblain LE (CLE), and LE tumidus (LET).

An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process.

Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common.

Dry eye in Sjogren\u0027s syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual\u0027s last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer\u0027s test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye.

Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions.

The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy. The mainstay of treatment is acid suppression which can be achieved with several classes of medications including antacids, histamine-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).", "disease_category": "Digestive system disease", "id": "n535", "ko": "H01602", "label": "n535", "labels": ":disease", "name": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "description": "Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare endocrinopathy caused by tumors of the pancreas and duodenum.

Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous. The cancer can be spread to other parts of the body, most commonly to regional lymph nodes and the liver.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated.

The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves\u0027 disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves\u0027 disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission.

Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea. The diagnosis of blepharitis is almost always based on the history and clinical examination. Long-term management of symptoms may include daily eyelid cleansing routines and the use of therapeutic agents that reduce infection and inflammation.

Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD.

Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD.

Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase.

Due to the unusual length, adhesive nature, and other cell surface properties of F. nucleatum, periodontal disease-causing bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Streptococcus spp. aggregate and thrive; hence, F. nucleatum is thought of as a \u0027bridge bacterium\u0027.", "disease_category": "Infectious disease", "id": "n574", "ko": "H01408", "label": "n574", "labels": ":disease", "name": "Periodontal disease", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "id": "n3926", "ko": "tde", "label": "n3926", "labels": ":pathogen", "name": "Treponema denticola", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "taxonomy": "Bacteria; Spirochaetes; Spirochaetales; Spirochaetaceae; Treponema"}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "id": "n3927", "ko": "tpk", "label": "n3927", "labels": ":pathogen", "name": "Treponema putidum", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "taxonomy": "Bacteria; Spirochaetes; Spirochaetales; Spirochaetaceae; Treponema"}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "id": "n3928", "ko": "trm", "label": "n3928", "labels": ":pathogen", "name": "Treponema sp.

It is caused by a persistent infection of the brain by an aberrant measles virus. Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.", "disease_category": "Infectious disease; Neurodegenerative disease", "id": "n1680", "ko": "H01696", "label": "n1680", "labels": ":disease", "name": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis", "shape": "dot", "size": 10}, {"color": "#97c2fc", "description": "Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus, a morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family of -ssRNA viruses.

Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies.

Anterior pituitary is composed of five cell types that secrete growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin hormone (ACTH). Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism are variable, often insidious in onset and dependent on the degree and severity of hormone deficiency. However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. A variety of diseases may cause hypopituitarism and, accordingly, this disorder can be divided into two types depending on its cause. Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan\u0027s syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children.

BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination).

The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID.

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21. Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer\u0027s disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain.
